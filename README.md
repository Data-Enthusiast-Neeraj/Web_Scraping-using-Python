ðŸ”¹ **Project Title: OTT Content Scraper â€“ Web Scraping from JustWatch using Python**

ðŸ“„ **Description:**

Built a robust web scraping solution to extract real-time OTT content data from the JustWatch website using Python. The project automated the collection of streaming platform data including movie/TV show titles, genres, release years, content type, streaming providers, ratings, and pricing information.

Utilized libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Selenium to handle dynamic content rendering and multiple page navigations. Data was processed and structured using Pandas and stored in CSV format for further analysis and visualization.

BeautifulSoup & lxml â€“ for HTML parsing

Requests â€“ for HTTP communication

Pandas â€“ for data cleaning and transformation

Time, Random â€“ to simulate human browsing behavior and avoid IP blocks



âœ… **Features & Capabilities:**

Extracts metadata for latest movies and series by filters like genre, language, and platform (e.g., Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, etc.)

Handles pagination and dynamically-loaded content efficiently

Cleans and formats raw HTML data into structured datasets

Supports export to CSV/Excel or SQLite for use in dashboards or analysis



ðŸŽ¯ **Outcome:**
The scraper successfully gathered structured OTT content data, which can be used for building recommendation engines, pricing trackers, or content comparison dashboards. Demonstrated hands-on skills in web automation, data engineering, and Python-based scraping tools.
